Testing Keystone with QEMU
====================================

`QEMU <https://www.qemu.org>`_ is an open source machine emulator.
The latest QEMU supports RISC-V ISA.

Keystone was tested in a QEMU fork in RISC-V (`GitHub <https://github.com/riscv/riscv-qemu>`_).
The upstream QEMU is not currently supported due to several remaining issues (Ex: `See GitHub issue <https://github.com/keystone-enclave/keystone/issues/25>`_).
Fixes will be upstreamed in the future.
